Creation Patterns: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype, Singleton.
Behavioral Patterns: Chain of Responsibility, Iterator, Observer, Strategy, Model Method.
Structural Patterns: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.

# Strategy
Simplify the variation of algorithms to solve the same problem.

#Facade
Provide an interface that reduces the complexity of integrations with subsystems.
